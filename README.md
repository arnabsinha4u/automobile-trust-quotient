# Automobile Trust Quotient
Create a platform which will digitally track and trace the history of an automobile (cars, trucks, buses, any vehicle et al) with inherent immutability on a blockchain, which will aid buyers to take informed decision and sellers to position their automobile better in the marketplace. Producers and Consumers of the platform will be various buyers, sellers, garages, part providers, paarts and car manufacturers, goverment bodies maintaining automobile periodic check and registration data"

In order to use this digital online immutable distributed ledger of information on automobiles, incentives will be given to all producers and consumers.

Once implemented:
Buyers can: Trust the information as it cannot be tampered and is available real time
Sellers can: Go to the market directly and get a good price, Keeping up the health of the car for a sustainable environment

# What problem this innovation is trying to solve?
From a retail consumer standpoint: The automobile market for second hand cars is enormous. This idea addresses two customer viewpoints, one the buyer, other the seller.

Today, when people go to buy a car:
 1) They look at the service book for a car for the service history
 2) Drives the car around to get a feel of it
 3) Takes the car to a garage, pays and gets it checked
 4) Searches websites and try and get paid reports
Based on the above factors, evidence and gut, the buyer decides, for or against buying the car
Even after this, buyers often get a short term protection insurance, adding further onto the cost of buying the car.
The extra cost that the buyer pays is 5-10%.

When cars are sold:
 1) Garages charge a percentage of the selling price of the car to the seller
 2) Lot of elements are fixed momentarily to just sell the car
 3) Authenticity of parts cannot always be determined
